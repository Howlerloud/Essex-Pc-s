        <ol>
          <li>Incompatible Parts</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CPU and Motherboard Compatibility. Please use the components checker we have linked</li>
            <li>RAM clearance depending on the CPU cooler chosen</li>
            <li>Power supply wattage not sufficient for high end GPUs</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- Improper Installation of Components:
        Please add to list above
Incorrectly seating the CPU or RAM in their slots.
Not properly installing the cooler or heatsink, leading to overheating.
Forgetting to connect cables like the 24-pin power or 8-pin CPU power.
Cable Management Problems:

Messy or poorly organized cables can obstruct airflow and make the system harder to work with.
Trapping cables in fans or between components.
Thermal Issues:

Insufficient cooling leading to high temperatures (especially for the CPU or GPU).
Poor thermal paste application on the CPU, or not applying it at all.
Faulty or Loose Connections:

Loose power cables, especially for GPU or motherboard connections.
Incorrectly plugged front panel connectors (e.g., power button, USB ports).
BIOS Issues:

Forgetting to update the BIOS, which may prevent the motherboard from recognizing the latest CPU.
Incorrect BIOS settings (e.g., enabling XMP profile for RAM). -->
