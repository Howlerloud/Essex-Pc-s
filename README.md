  <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
<img src="assets/readme_media/palete.jpg">
<p>The website incorporates dark colours, this gives a more professional feel to the site as well as making it easier on the eyes. The dark colours chosen incorperate well into the Pc images and backgrounds used.</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>I have chosen Arial sans-serif as my font, this font is both easy to read giving great access to visually impaired users and is one of the most compatible fonts on the internet. </p>

<h2>Imagery</h2>
<p>The images used are all technology themed, including motherboards, pc cases and desktop setups.</p>
<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>Wireframes were created for desktop and mobile use using wireframe.cc </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The website consists of 4 pages, the home page, the builds page, the contact us page and the feedback page. The home page consists of 3 sections giving detailed instruction of what to consider when choosing your new pc parts, the second showcasing a video of how to build your own pc and the last listing common causes of pc faults</p>
<ul>
  <li>All the pages will consist of a navigation bar that aligns to the left side of the screen that scales with the size of the viewers resolution. Once the resolution hits 700px wide the website adjusts moving the navigation bar from the left to the top of the screen using a media query, this improves the users experience. The navigation bar will have a background of a motherboard that contrasts well with the font colour. The navigation bar will include links the Home, Contact us and Builds page.  </li>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Testing was key throughout the development of the project. I utilised the edge inspect tool multiple times and the chrome developer tool throughout testing to check and assess key issues with the website</p>
<p>The following issues were raised during the projects development</p>
<ul>
  <li>When changing the window size of builds before it hit the 700px media query mark the inline builds would become staggered. Fixed by simply using vertical-align: top; to stop the adjustment when changing screen sizes</li> </li>
  <li>When the website was viewed at lest than 700px width the images would overlap the fixed navigation bar. Fixed using z index to give the navbar priority.</li>
  <li>When building the website capital letters were used for file paths, this caused issues when it was uploaded to github and was corrected to allow compatibility</li>
  <li>During the  initiall planning of the website the chosen background colour was to be white but this was found to be hard on the eyes to viewers and was corrected early on in the development</li>
  <li>Originally my forms used a javascript syntax to inform the user that all form boxes needed to be filler out using a pop up. It worked locally but when uploaded to git it would produce a 405 error. To address this I eventually used a "required" attribute instead.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Testing Links</h4>
<ol>
  <li>All internal links were tested on the index page and worked. All external links opened in a new tab at took you to the correct address.</li>
  <li>All internal links were tested on the find us page worked. All external links opened in a new tab at took you to the correct address.</li>
  <li>All internal links were tested on the builds page worked. All external links opened in a new tab at took you to the correct address.</li>
  <li>All internal links were tested on the form page worked. All external links opened in a new tab at took you to the correct address.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Testing Forms</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Trying to submit the feedback form with no fields filled will prompt the user to fill in the email first.</li>
  <li>Trying to submit the feedback form with just the email filled in will then be prompted to fill in the feedback section</li>
  <li>Once both email and feedback have been filled will the form allowed to be sent</li>
</ol>
<h3>W3C Validator</h3>
<p>The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. Jigsaw was used to validate CSS in the style.css file.</p>

<h3>Solved Bugs</h3>
<ol>
  <li>As mentioned before in the builds page when the screen was resized on desktop the containers holding the builds would become mis aligned and start to stagger, this would get worse the smaller the screen size up untill the media query at 700px would fix it. To stop my inline items from staggering I used the vertical-align:top; CSS to fix the issue meaning all my inline blocks would stay at the same level</li>
  <li>When scrolling on mobile the images would overlap the navbar as the navbar had changed positions to the top of the screen instead of being aligned left. This was fixed using the z index CSS to give the narbar priority over all over media files</li>
  <li>Initially the first picture on the index page would slowly overlap the text when resizing the screen. This was fixed by using the justify left CSS and instead of using px to size the image it was changed to view width to allow for resizing</li>
  <li>The Feedback form would post even if there was no content, Java script was added to return a message to the user that all fields needed to be filled in for them to send their feedback</li>
</ol>

<h3>Performance Testing</h3>
<h2>Lighthouse</h2>
<p>I used lighthouse an inbuilt chrome developer tool that tests the webpage on 4 metrics, performance, accessibility,best practices and SEO</p>
<p>Index page scores desktop</p>
<img src="assets/readme_media/index_lighthouse.jpg">
  <p>Index page scores mobile</p>
<img src="assets/readme_media/index_lighthouse_mobile.jpg">
<p>Builds page scores</p>
<img src="assets/readme_media/builds_lighthouse.jpg">
  <p>Builds page scores mobile</p>
<img src="assets/readme_media/builds_lighthouse_mobile.jpg">
<p>Find us page scores</p>
<img src="assets/readme_media/find_us_lighthouse.jpg">
  <p>find us page scores mobile</p>
<img src="assets/readme_media/find_us_lighthouse_mobile.jpg">
<p>Form page scores</p>
<img src="assets/readme_media/form_lighthouse.jpg">
  <p>form page scores mobile</p>
<img src="assets/readme_media/form_lighthouse_mobile.jpg">
<p>When testing my webpage using lighthouse it highlights the fact my navigation bar takes the longest to load due to the jpg and the size of the bar. To help I used tinypng to compress the image. It instead recommends updating my jpg to the next gen format WebP and AVIF.</p>
<br>
<p>Lighthouse also suggests preconnecting third party origins like my youtube iframe</p>
