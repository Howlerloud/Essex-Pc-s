  <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
<img src="media/palete.jpg">
<p>The website incorperates dark colours, this gives a more professional feel to the site as well as making it easier on the eyes. The dark colours chosen incorperate well into the Pc images and backgrounds used.</p>
<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>I have chosen Arial sans-serif as my font, this font is both easy to read giving great access to vissualy impaired users and is one of the most compatible fonts on the internet. </p>

<h2>Imagery</h2>
<p>The images used are all technology themed, including motherboards, pc cases and desktop setups.</p>
<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>Wireframes were created for desktop and mobile use using wireframe.cc </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The website is comprised of 4 pages, the home page, the builds page, the contact us page and the feedback page. The home page consists of 3 sections giving detailed instruction of what to consider when choosing your new pc parts, the second showcasing a video of how to build your own pc and the last listing common causes of pc faults</p>
<ul>
  <li>All the pages will consist of a navigation bar that aligns to the left side of the screen that scales with the size of the viewers resolution. Once the resolution hits 700px wide the website adjusts moving the navigation bar from the left to the top of the screen using a media query, this improves the users experience. The navigation bar will have a background of a motherboard that contrasts well with the font colour. The navigation bar will include links the Home, Contact us and Builds page.  </li>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Testing was key throughout the development of the project. I utilised the edge inspect tool mutiple times through testing to check and assess key issues with the website</p>
<p>The following issues were raised during the projects development</p>
<ul>
  <li>When changing the window size of builds before it hit the 700px media query mark the inline builds would become staggered. Fixed by simply using vertical-align: top; to stop the adjustment when chaing screen sizes</li> </li>
  <li>When the website was viewed at lest than 700px width the images would overlap the fixed navigation bar. Fixed using z index to give the navbar priority.</li>
  <li>When building the website capital letters were used for filepaths, this caused issues when it was uploaded to github and was corrected to allow compatibility</li>
  <li>During the inital planning of the website the chosen background colour was to be white but this was found to be hard on the eyes to viewers and was corrected early on in the development</li>
</ul>
<h3>W3C Validator</h3>
<p>The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.</p>
<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<h3>Solved Bugs</h3>
<ol>
  <li>As mentions before in the builds page when the screen was resized on desktop the containers holding the builds would become mis aligned and start to stagger, this would get worse the smaller the screen size up untill the media query at 700px would fix it. To stop my inlign items from staggering I used the vertical-align:top; CSS to fix the issue meaning all my inline blocks would stay at the same level</li>
  <li>When scrolling on moblile the images would overlap the navbar as the navbar had changed positions to the top of the screen instead of being aligned left. This was fixed useing the z index CSS to give the narbar priority over all over media files</li>
  <li>Initially the first picture on the index page would slowly overlap the text when resizing the screen. This was fixed by using the justify left CSS and instead of using px to size the image it was changed to view width to allow for resizing</li>
</ol>



  
</ol>
   <hr>
   <li>Solved bugs include form page content shoved to the right even though no navbar was present. Fixed by swapping the main attribute out for a new "margin" class.</li>
   <li>When changing the window size of builds the inline builds would become staggered. Fixed by simply using vertical-align: top; to stop the adjustment when chaing screen sizes</li>
 </ul>
